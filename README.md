This repository contains the implementation of two deep learning models as part of the COMP3547 Deep Learning module at Durham University. The coursework involved designing and training a classifier and a generative model using the CIFAR-100 dataset.

## Overview

### Discriminative Model
The discriminative model is designed to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. The model is constrained to have fewer than 100,000 parameters and is trained for no more than 10,000 optimization steps.

### Generative Model
The generative model aims to synthesize unique and realistic images based on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The model must have fewer than 1,000,000 parameters and is trained for no more than 50,000 optimization steps.
